## Overview
Allows the WiFi control of a WS8212 LED strip using an ESP8266 controller and an MQTT broker. Designed to work well with Home Assistant https://home-assistant.io/.

To use this code simply configure the PIN and NUMPIXELS variables in the NeoPixel section. You will also need to configure the credentials for your WiFi and MQTT broker, see <REDACTED> code. Lastly you can tailor the MQTT topics as required.

## Features
* Works well with Home Assistant.
* Includes 9 animations.
* Basic control using simple MQTT commands (e.g. "1" to turn on, "0" to turn off).
* Advanced control using JSON MQTT commands.
* Tweak animation variables without needing to alter code.
* Utilizes a non-blocking reconnect function allowing animations to continue if MQTT or WiFi connection is lost.
* Automatic Recovery - All variables are published as a retained message to a recovery topic. If the ESP is restarted this message is used to return to the previous state.
* Retained Statuses - The state is published as a retained message allowing your hub (e.g. Home Assistant) to grab the current state if it is restarted.
* You can optionally enable ArduinoOTA to make uploading changes easier.

## Change Log
29/05/2023
* Function 5 modified to audio ritmic NOT TESTED
* ArduinoJson5 to ArduinoJson6 NOT TESTED


19/06/2019
* Config is now in a separate file.
* 2 new animations added.

09/12/2018
* Added support for ArduinoOTA.
* Availability is now published every 30 seconds.

21/11/2018
* Removed brightness control WIP.
* Limited calls to pixels.show() as some were causing a WTD reset.
* Updated MQTT topic variable names in line with Home Assistant.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required and so must be present when compiling.

* Arduino
* ESP8266WiFi
* PubSubClient
* Adafruit_NeoPixel
* ArduinoJson
* ArduinoOTA.h (if ArduinoOTA enabled)
* WiFiUdp.h (if ArduinoOTA enabled)
* ESP8266mDNS.h (if ArduinoOTA enabled)

#### JSON Example
The message below would turn all LEDs to Blue (Mode = 1, rgbColourTwo = Blue). See tables below for message options.

`{0:1,2:[0,0,255]}`

## Home Assistant Examples
**light:**
Basic control of a light.
```
  mqtt:
   light: 
   - name: Lamp
     state_topic: "/light/led/state"
     command_topic: "/light/led"
     rgb_state_topic: "/light/led/rgb/state"
     rgb_command_topic: "/light/led/rgb"
     availability:
       - topic: "/light/led/availability"
         payload_not_available: "0"
         payload_available: "1"
     payload_off: "0"
     payload_on: "1"
     retain: false
     qos: 0 
```
Note: The recovery topic does not need to be used in the Home Assistant config.

**input_select:**
UI to allow user to trigger an animation.
```
input_select:
  lamp:
    name: Lamp
    options:
      - "Select..."
      - "Warm Light"
      - "Strobe"
      - "Fire"
      - "Colour Phase"
      - "Sparkle"
      - "Shoot / Drip"
      - "Rain"
      - "Rainbow 1"
      - "Rainbow 2"
    initial: "Select..."
```

**automation:**
Sends the appropriate MQTT command when a mode is selected and then returns the input select back to 'Select...'
```
alias: Lamp Mode
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - input_select.lamp

  - service: mqtt.publish

          {0:2,2:[255,147,41]}
        {% elif trigger.to_state.state == 'Strobe' %}
          {0:3}
        {% elif trigger.to_state.state == 'Fire' %}
          {0:4}
        {% elif trigger.to_state.state == 'Colour Phase' %}
          {0:5,3:15}

        {% elif trigger.to_state.state == 'Rain' %}
          {0:8,11:1100}
        {% elif trigger.to_state.state == 'Rainbow 1' %}
          {0:12}
        {% elif trigger.to_state.state == 'Rainbow 2' %}
          {0:13}
        {% else %}
          {}
        {% endif %}
  - service: input_select.select_option
    data:
